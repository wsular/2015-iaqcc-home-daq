Intensive Measurements Campaign Data Acquisition
================================================

Indoor Air Quality (2015)
-------------------------

    > This repository is not comprehensive (yet).

This repository covers the data acquisition systems deployed during intensive,
relatively brief in-home measurement campaigns. The wireless sensor network
(CO2/T/P/RH) is hosted [in a separate repository][1].

* **Indoor measurements** :: A [Campbell Scientific][2] datalogger is used to
  aggregate data streams, provide local storage and make periodic reports via
  email and to an instance of  [ScadaBR][3]. The indoor sampling suite contains
  the following instruments:
    * [DustTrak II (Model 8530) by TSI, Inc.][4]
    * [DC1100 by Dylos Corp.][5]
    * [Model 205 by 2B Tech][6]
    * [Model 405 nm by 2B Tech][7]
    * [GGA-30p by Los Gatos Research Inc][8]
    * Future: [LI-840A by LI-COR Biosciences Inc][9]
