*Third-party documentation*

To keep things light and respect copyright, documents produced by third-parties
are not allowed here. Instead, retrieve third-party documentation by:

  * Drag-n-dropping `_documents.txt` onto `_fetch.py` or
  * Manually visiting the URLs listed in `_documents.txt`

When updating `_documents.txt` ensure the desired destination file name follows
the URL, separated by *precisely* four spaces.
